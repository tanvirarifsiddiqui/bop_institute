Project Overview
Our institute, Bob Institute, has an existing Laravel web application using Laravel Breeze for user and admin authentication. Users can log in and explore science formulations. We now aim to extend this application by adding comprehensive course management features.

Course Management Extension
Course Types
We have three types of courses:

Long Courses (Academic)

Short Courses (Non-Academic)

Industrial Attachment Programs (Medium Courses)

Base Requirements
Each course type contains multiple Programs (categories of courses). There should be a CRUD system for managing Programs.

Each Program can have multiple Courses with the following attributes:

Course ID (inputted by admin)

Course Name

Session (for Long Courses)

Batch (for Short Courses and Industrial Attachment Programs)

Course Fee

Duration

Apply option

Each Course can be Online or Offline, fully controlled by the admin.

Short Courses and Industrial Attachment Programs do not have sessions; instead, they are organized into Batches with specific start dates.

System Architecture
User Access Flow
Guest Users:

Can explore available courses and programs.

Cannot apply for courses.

Student Registration Workflow:

Guest/User fills out the Student Registration Form.

Submission goes to the Admin for approval.

Upon admin approval:

Student's dashboard status changes from Pending to Active.

Student data is stored in the Students database table.

Course Application Workflow:

Active Students can access the Student Portal.

Students can Apply for available courses.

Applications are sent to the Admin for enrollment processing.

Admin enrolls the student in the selected course.

The enrolled course appears on the student's portal dashboard.

Database Design
To support this architecture, we'll incorporate the following entities:


1. Students (Student Profiles)

2. Course Types

3. Programs

4. Sessions (for Long Courses)

5. Batches (for Short Courses and medium Courses)

6. Courses

7. Student Registrations

8. Course Applications

9. Enrollments

Front-End Development
Use Blade Templates for views.

Implement styling with Bootstrap and necessary icon CDNs.

Ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface.

Break the implementation into 10 phases. Based on your deep thinking capabilities, provide a phase-by-phase (10 phases) guideline plan to develop this system. I will ask you for detailed information about each phase specifically. Right now, just give me the planning.

[note that: for student registration it is not necessary to login the system/ or being a user. user or guest(non registered users) both are able to register as a student.]
